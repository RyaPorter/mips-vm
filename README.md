# MIPS VM

![Ubuntu](https://github.com/RyaPorter/mips-vm/workflows/Ubuntu/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Intro
MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture. This project is an ongoing attempt to create a rudementary virtual machine that can execute code assembled for this instruction set.

## Goals
- [x] Create the different virtual hardware components
- - [x] CPU - Registers, fetch, decode, execute.
- - [x] Memory (Implemented as a uint32 array)
- - [ ] Implement instruction set
- - [ ] Implement rudamentary assembler
