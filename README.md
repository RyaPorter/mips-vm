# Intro
MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture. This project attempts to create a rudementary virtual machine that can execute the various instructions present in the architecture.

## Goals
- [x] Create the different hardware elements
- - [x] CPU - Registers, fetch, decode, execute.
- - [x] Memory (Implemented as a uint32 array)
